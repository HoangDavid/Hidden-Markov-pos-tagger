# Hidden-Markov-pos-tagger

# NLP Part-of-Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Model

## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for natural language processing tasks. The model is designed to accurately predict the grammatical parts of speech for words in a given text.
